This is a stand-in for a slice of the NAPS stimuli dataset, it should be
replaced by a proper CSV formatted file without a header. See example below.

The used slice was the NAPS ALL (male and female scores), with the image label,
valance and arousal values.

Expected format is a CSV without a header. The implied header is
Label(string), Valance(double), Arousal(double)

Assumed delimiter is comma (,).

The source data was provided by the Nencki Institute in Poland
(http://en.nencki.gov.pl/).

Example with dummy values (proper CSV starting after this line):
"snake",1.234,4.321
